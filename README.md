> This project is a full-stack **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Knowledge Graph Vault** built with Obsidian. It covers a wide range of areas including machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, mathematical foundations, numerical optimization, and more. Knowledge is connected through [[bidirectional links]] to help build a truly **scalable, visualized, and modular AI knowledge system**.

## 🌐Why I Built This Vault

  

I'm currently a sophomore undergraduate student with a research interest in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. As I delved deeper into AI, I found myself constantly challenged by the fragmented nature of machine learning algorithms and the heavy mathematical background (especially in areas like linear algebra, probability, and optimization). These knowledge gaps often became bottlenecks in my learning journey.

  

To address this, I decided to **build a personal AI knowledge vault** — a system that helps me organize, connect, and visualize the foundational and advanced topics involved in AI research. Whether it's for working on NLP, Computer Vision (CV), Computer Graphics (CG), or any downstream deep learning task, this vault aims to **systematically collect and integrate essential knowledge**.(CV, CG's contents TBD)

  

> This is a personal and evolving knowledge base. It may not be perfect, but I sincerely welcome anyone interested to contribute and help improve it by submitting a Pull Request (PR). Let's learn and grow together!

## 📚 Features

>[!info] Note
>This repository is primarily intended to **build a structured knowledge network**, rather than provide in-depth explanations of individual concepts. It focuses on mapping connections between topics to help users see the bigger picture and navigate through related areas more effectively.

  

### ✅ Native graph visualization based on Obsidian  

Uses Obsidian's built-in Graph View to present a clear knowledge network.

  

### ✅ Covers the full AI stack  

From mathematical foundations to mainstream algorithm models, this vault helps you build a systematic AI learning path.

  

### ✅ Continuously expandable with personal note style  

Follows Obsidian-style markdown syntax, easy to customize, maintain, and search.

  

### ✅ Zero dependencies, portable plain text  

No complex setup required. All content is in plain Markdown, viewable by any markdown editor.

## 📂 Knowledge Graph Structure Overview

  You can view in your own vault in obsidian built-in 
  

Each `.md` file is an independent knowledge node, connected via `[[links]]`.

## 🚀 How to Use

  
  

```bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

```

  

Then open the folder as a new Vault in Obsidian:



> 1. Open Obsidian  

> 2. Choose "Open folder as vault"  

> 3. Navigate to the project directory

>[!note] 
>I strongly recommend that you open this repository as an Obsidian vault, as some contents may fail to render properly due to the specific plugins I use.




## 📖 Who Is This For

  

- AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning learners  

- Anyone building a long-term personal knowledge system  

- Note-taking enthusiasts / Obsidian users / Markdown writers
